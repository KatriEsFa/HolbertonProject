      <h4>History!</h4>
      <strong> 20th century</strong></br>

      Palacio Salvo, built in Montevideo from 1925 to 1928, was once the tallest building in Latin America.
      The Colorado leader José Batlle y Ordóñez was elected president in 1903. The following year, the Blancos led a
      rural revolt and eight bloody months of fighting ensued before their leader, Aparicio Saravia, was killed in
      battle. Government forces emerged victorious, leading to the end of the co-participation politics that had begun
      in 1872. Batlle had two terms (1903–07 and 1911–15) during which, taking advantage of the nation's stability and
      growing economic prosperity, he instituted major reforms, such as a welfare program, government participation in
      many facets of the economy, and a plural executive.

      Gabriel Terra became president in March 1931. His inauguration coincided with the effects of the Great
      Depression, and the social climate became tense as a result of the lack of jobs. There were confrontations in
      which police and leftists died. In 1933, Terra organized a coup d'état, dissolving the General Assembly and
      governing by decree. A new constitution was promulgated in 1934, transferring powers to the president. In
      general, the Terra government weakened or neutralized economic nationalism and social reform.

      In 1938, general elections were held and Terra's brother-in-law, General Alfredo Baldomir, was elected
      president. Under pressure from organized labor and the National Party, Baldomir advocated free elections,
      freedom of the press, and a new constitution. Although Baldomir declared Uruguay neutral in 1939, British
      warships and the German ship Admiral Graf Spee fought a battle not far off Uruguay's coast. The Admiral Graf
      Spee took refuge in Montevideo, claiming sanctuary in a neutral port, but was later ordered out.

      In the late 1950s, partly because of a worldwide decrease in demand for Uruguyan agricultural products,
      Uruguayans suffered from a steep drop in their standard of living, which led to student militancy and labor
      unrest. An armed group, known as the Tupamaros emerged in the 1960s, engaging in activities such as bank
      robbery, kidnapping and assassination, in addition to attempting an overthrow of the government.
